        <p>MUMentum was set up back in March 2022, driven by a longing to connect with like-minded mothers and indulge in the things we missed out on during lockdown. Let's face it, the pandemic put our social lives on hold for way too long, and we needed a platform that could foster genuine friendships and help us all reclaim a sense of joy and purpose outside of our home life. Fast forward to today, and MUMentum has become a tight-knit community located in the wonderful city of York, with over 600 mums connected through our Facebook group. Our mission is simple yet important - we aim to support and promote social wellbeing to all mothers in and around York through our organised events. And guess what? We've already hosted over 30 of them!</p><br/>

        <p>Being a mother is one of life's most rewarding yet challenging roles, and we believe every mum deserves some time out for herself to relax and recharge. We understand first-hand how easy it is to lose your sense of identity after giving birth. That's why we're committed to making a difference in the lives of mums, helping them rediscover their passions and feel whole again. Our mission is all about creating a supportive community for mums, offering them opportunities to connect with each other, share experiences, and enjoy doing things they might have done before having kids. We've achieved this through the various events we organise, providing a fun and friendly platform for mums to socialize and learn from one another.</p><br/>

        <p>So, if you're a mum in or around York, we'd love for you to come to our events! At MUMentum, we believe that being a mother doesn't mean you have to miss out on fun and friendship. In fact, we think it's even more important to take time out for yourself and connect with other like-minded mums. So why not join us and rediscover the joys of motherhood together? We can't wait to meet you!</p>
