      <h3>Founder and Director</h3>
      <br/>
      <p>I'm mum to 2 lively kids who keep me on my toes! I created this group because, let's be honest, making mum friends can be tough. That's why I wanted to create something different - a community where mums could meet without their kids, do things they love, and make genuine friendships along the way. As a mum myself, I know how easy it is to lose yourself once you have kids. It's all too easy to forget who you were before the sleepless nights and endless laundry piles. That's why at MUMentum, we're all about helping mums rediscover their passions, have some fun, and connect with like-minded women.</p>

      <p>I'm one of your friendly MUMentum volunteers, and I can't wait to get to know you all! As a single mum who works full-time, I know how busy life can get. But when I'm not running around after my energetic 4-year-old daughter, you'll often find me working up a sweat at the gym or soaking up some live music.</p>

      <p>I'm super passionate about a few things in life - feminism, fitness, and food (not necessarily in that order!). So if you're looking for someone to chat with about your favorite workout routine, share your thoughts on the latest foodie trends, or discuss important issues related to women's rights, I'm your girl!</p>

      <p>I am thrilled to be apart of this wonderful community and something truly special!
      <p>I am a young, autistic mum who is fairly new to parenting but very familiar with children after studying and working with them full time. Until now, I've found meeting other mums and socialising quite tricky so needless to say finding this group was a godsend.</p>
      <p>I love anything Halloween/autumn, book related and getting stuck in with crafty projects!</p>

      <p>I'm a first-time mum living near the centre of York, and when I'm not chasing my curious 3-year-old around, I love to curl up with a good book or explore the great outdoors. Pagan spirituality is something that's really important to me, and I always enjoy discussing it with like-minded folks.</p>

      <p>So if you're a fellow bookworm, nature lover, or just someone who wants to hang out and chat about mum life and all its ups and downs, then I'd love to meet you! Let's swap stories and share some laughs - can't wait to see you at our next event!</p>
