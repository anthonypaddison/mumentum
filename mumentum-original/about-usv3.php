        <p><span class="newfont"><b>MUMentum</b></span> was set up back in March 2022, driven by a longing to connect with like-minded mothers and indulge in the things we missed out on during lockdown. Let's face it, the pandemic put our social lives on hold for way too long, and we needed a platform that could foster genuine friendships and help us all reclaim a sense of joy and purpose outside of our home life. Fast forward to today, and MUMentum has become a tight-knit community located in the wonderful city of York, with over 600 mums connected through our Facebook group. Our mission is simple yet important - we aim to support and promote social wellbeing to all mothers in and around York through our organised events. And guess what? We've already hosted over 30 of them!</p>

        <p>Being a mother is one of life's most rewarding yet challenging roles, and we believe every mum deserves some time out for herself to relax and recharge. We understand first-hand how easy it is to lose your sense of identity after giving birth. That's why we're committed to making a difference in the lives of mums, helping them rediscover their passions and feel whole again. Our mission is all about creating a supportive community for mums, offering them opportunities to connect with each other, share experiences, and enjoy doing things they might have done before having kids. We've achieved this through the various events we organise, providing a fun and friendly platform for mums to socialize and learn from one another.</p>

                <p>Hey there, I'm the founder of MUMentum and a mum to 2 lively kids who keep me on my toes! I created this group because, let's be honest, making mum friends can be tough. I mean, how do you even find the time between school runs, nappy changes, and snack requests, right? And don't even get me started on trying to make meaningful connections during playgroups!</p>

                <p>That's why I wanted to create something different - a community where mums could meet without their kids, do things they love, and make genuine friendships along the way. As a mum myself, I know how easy it is to lose yourself once you have kids. It's all too easy to forget who you were before the sleepless nights and endless laundry piles. That's why at MUMentum, we're all about helping mums rediscover their passions, have some fun, and connect with like-minded women.</p>

                <p>I'm one of your friendly MUMentum volunteers, and I can't wait to get to know you all! As a single mum who works full-time, I know how busy life can get. But when I'm not running around after my energetic 4-year-old daughter, you'll often find me working up a sweat at the gym or soaking up some live music.</p>

                <p>I'm super passionate about a few things in life - feminism, fitness, and food (not necessarily in that order!). So if you're looking for someone to chat with about your favorite workout routine, share your thoughts on the latest foodie trends, or discuss important issues related to women's rights, I'm your girl!

                <p>I am a young, autistic mum who is fairly new to parenting but very familiar with children after studying and working with them full time. Until now, I've found meeting other mums and socialising quite tricky so needless to say finding this group was a godsend.</p>
                <p>I love anything Halloween/autumn, book related and getting stuck in with crafty projects!</p>

Pagan spirituality is something that's really important to me, and I always enjoy discussing it with like-minded folks.</p>
